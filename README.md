# Crypto Exchange Simulator ðŸš€

This project is a **simulator of a real cryptocurrency exchange**, allowing users to trade virtual assets in real-time!  

## Getting Started  

Follow these steps to set up and run the application.

### 1. Clone the Repository  

First, download the project using Git:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/GeorgiGeorgiev0320/crypto-sim.git
cd <your-project-folder>
```

### 2. Start the Frontend  

1. Navigate to the `frontend/` directory:
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```  
   - The frontend should automatically open in your browser at **http://localhost:3000**.  

3. Start the Backend

- Open the backend/ folder in IntelliJ IDEA or any Java-supported IDE of your choice.

- The backend is built with Spring Web, WebSockets, and Spring Security (currently disabled).

- By default, it runs on localhost:8080, but this can be changed in the properties folder.

- Run the application (ensure dependencies are installed).

- Open the backend/ folder in IntelliJ IDEA or any Java-supported IDE of your choice.

- Run the application (ensure dependencies are installed).

-Note: When the backend is first started, not all cryptocurrencies may show immediately. 
The real-time data from the Kraken WebSocket API will start loading gradually. Some cryptos may take a moment to appear as they are fetched.

### 4. Test the Application  

Once both the frontend and backend are running, **refresh the webpage**, and you're ready to go! ðŸŽ‰
